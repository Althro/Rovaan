# 0.1 - Faal Rovaan Dovahkien

*Released to dev team* : `tbc`

**Notes** : New major dev milestone. Completely reworked everything from textures and gameplay to expansions, NPC's and more. This version should be more stable and is more inline with the new vision for the modlist. TLDR: New name, new direction, big changes. **This is seriously not save compatible. Don't even think of trying.**
